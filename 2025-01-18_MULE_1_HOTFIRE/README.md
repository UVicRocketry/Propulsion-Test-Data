Mule-1 hot fire and cold flow test conducted with N2O and paraffin wax at the Malahat Fish and Game range.

Cold Flow (Data 0), Hot Fire (Data 1)

It was particularly cold that day (6C or so) meaning N2O saturation pressure was lower than desirable. No issues encountered with instrumentation or controls. A cold flow was conducted before the hot fire to ensure filling and firing capability was working.

Note that `T_COMB_CHAMB, T_POST_COMB` were not in use as their sensors were not installed and damaged, respectivly.

This was UVR's first completely nominal hot fire, with no failures occuring. The thrust for Mule-1 was ~25% lower than expected, the cause of this is unclear with multiple possible explanations. A few are as follows. The injector was improperly characterized or dirty which lowered its coefficient of discharge and thus increased its pressure drop. The regulator for the nitrogen supply had a insufficient flow rate to main constant pressure during the test, resulting in lower overall system pressure.

Additional test were going to be conducted to determine the feasibility of the JSauce material. Unfortunately the lockout key was left in the PDP, resulting in it being unknowlingly safe-d preventing further tests in the remaining availiable time.
