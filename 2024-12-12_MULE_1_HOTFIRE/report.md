Mule-1 cold flow and first hotfire test conducted with N2O and paraffin wax at the Malahat Fish and Game range.

It was particularly cold that day (6C or so) meaning N2O saturation pressure was lower than desirable. This was anticipated, so the nitrogen blowdown system was reimplemented to increase runtank pressure to about 750psi. Two coldflows were conducted before hotfire, both using the blowdown system, and neither using the injector assembly. During the first coldflow (data0), the system was pressurized and left to sit to check for leaks. A leak was discovered and fixed for the subsequent cold flow (data1) about 15 minutes later. This cold flow showed the leak had been resolved. One issue that was discovered between the coldflows was that the nitrogen line connected to P\_N2\_FLOW saw a substantial increase in pressure from about 750psi to 1100psi. It is believed that this was due to the previous cold flow cooling the N2 tank and lines. This let the leftover N2 in the line experience a large pressure increase as it warmed back to air temperature. It was not confirmed if this was the case however.

During the hotfire (data2), an unfortunate failure mode was discovered. In the ignition sequence the ignitor was energized, smoke began pouring from the nozzle, approximately 5 seconds passed before the NCV was opened to allow N2O to flow. The ignitor was never turned off, and as combustion began, the insulation on the copper wires supplying power to the ignitor melted and shorted together. This caused the 24V power supply to droop from excess current draw, which caused the solenoids of both the NCV and RTV to de-energize. This was confirmed in video footage. It is also believed that this excessive power draw (at the end of a 80m extension cord) caused issues with the LabJack DAQ because instrumentation cut out as soon as the engine ignited.
